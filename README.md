# **LOAN DEFAULT MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT**

In this project, the aim is to predict bank customer defaults (label 0: Non-Default, label 1: Default) depending on a plethora of features. In this process, I would like to both achieve the highest accuracy possible, the lowest recall possible on Customer defaults, while also understanding the main features that can lead to a customer default. To achieve both of our goals, I decided to follow this pipeline:

- Understand our independent features, as well as our target variable.
- Prepare and process our dataset.
- Feature Engineering.
- Machine Learning Models, Hyperparameter tunning, and Evaluation.
